## 🐛 KNOWN ISSUES

### Minor Issues
1. **Admin Dashboard** - Too complex, needs refactoring
2. **TypeScript Types** - Some `any` types used for quick fixes
3. **Error Handling** - Could be more robust
4. **Loading States** - Could be more polished

### Missing Features (Not Critical)
1. **WebSocket Not Started** - Reverb server needs to be started
2. **Email Not Configured** - SMTP settings needed
3. **File Uploads** - Frontend UI exists but not wired to API
4. **Notifications Table** - Database table doesn't exist yet

### None of these block basic functionality ✅
