## 💡 Recommendations

### Before Production:
1. ⚠️ Replace payment gateway test keys with production keys
2. ⚠️ Set up proper email service (SMTP/SendGrid)
3. ⚠️ Configure Redis for caching and sessions
4. ⚠️ Set up queue workers for background jobs
5. ⚠️ Enable rate limiting on sensitive endpoints
6. ⚠️ Set up proper logging (Papertrail/LogRocket)
7. ⚠️ Configure CORS for frontend domain
8. ⚠️ Set APP_DEBUG=false in production
9. ⚠️ Set up SSL certificates (HTTPS)
10. ⚠️ Run security audit

### Performance Optimization:
1. Add database indexes on frequently queried fields
2. Implement Redis caching for expensive queries
3. Add query result caching
4. Optimize image uploads (compression, CDN)
5. Implement API response caching
6. Set up database connection pooling
