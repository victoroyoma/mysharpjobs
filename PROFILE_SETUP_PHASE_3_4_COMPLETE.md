  - Uses existing `ProtectedRoute` component for authentication

---

## ⏳ Remaining Tasks (15%)

### **Phase 4: Profile Completion Check** (Not Started)
- **Update ProtectedRoute Component**
  - Check if user has `profileCompleted === false`
  - Redirect incomplete profiles to `/profile-setup/{userType}` when accessing dashboard
  - Allow profile setup pages without profile completion check (avoid redirect loop)
  - Whitelist routes that don't require profile completion

### **Phase 5: Testing & Polish** (Not Started)
1. **Integration Testing**
   - Test complete flow: Register → Profile Setup → Dashboard
   - Test skip functionality and dashboard access
   - Test form validation at each step
   - Test API error handling
   - Test profile completion persistence

2. **Edge Cases**
   - User tries to access profile setup after completion
   - User refreshes during profile setup
   - Network errors during submission
   - Invalid data submission

3. **UI/UX Enhancements**
   - Add profile completion banner to dashboards for skipped profiles
   - Add "Complete Profile" call-to-action for incomplete profiles
   - Consider adding profile completion percentage to user avatar/header
