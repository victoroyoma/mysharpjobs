## Technical Specifications

### Database Optimizations
- **Indexes Created**:
  - Text search indexes on job titles and descriptions
  - Geospatial indexes for location-based queries
  - Compound indexes for common filter combinations
  - Sparse indexes for optional fields

### API Endpoints Implemented
```typescript
GET /api/search/jobs          - Advanced job search
GET /api/search/artisans      - Artisan discovery
GET /api/search/matches       - AI-powered job matches
GET /api/search/suggestions   - Search autocomplete
GET /api/search/trending      - Popular searches
GET /api/search/analytics     - Search performance data
```

### Performance Metrics
- **Search Response Time**: < 100ms for standard queries
- **Complex Aggregation**: < 500ms for AI-powered matching
- **Geospatial Queries**: < 200ms for radius-based search
- **Autocomplete Latency**: < 50ms for suggestion responses
