# Client Profile - Editable Profile Implementation Complete

## 🎯 Issue Fixed
The "Edit Profile" button in the Client Dashboard was not triggering the opening of the client profile page for editing.

## 🔍 Root Cause
The "Edit Profile" button in the ClientDashboard component had no `onClick` handler, so clicking it did nothing.

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. **Fixed Edit Profile Button in ClientDashboard**

**File:** `src/pages/Dashboard/ClientDashboard.tsx`

**Before:**
```tsx
<Button variant="secondary">
  Edit Profile
</Button>
```

**After:**
```tsx
<Button 
  variant="secondary"
  onClick={() => navigate('/client/profile')}
>
  Edit Profile
</Button>
```

Now the button properly navigates to `/client/profile`.
