  "message": "User details retrieved successfully",
  "data": {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "type": "artisan",
    "phone": "+1234567890",
    "location": "Lagos, Nigeria",
    "profile_image": "https://...",
    "bio": "...",
    "skills": ["plumbing", "electrical"],
    "stats": {
      "assigned_jobs": 45,
      "active_jobs": 3,
      "completed_jobs": 42,
      "total_earnings": 125000.00,
      "rating": 4.8,
      "total_reviews": 38
    },
    "recent_jobs": [...],
    "recent_payments": [...],
    "account_info": {
      "is_verified": true,
      "is_suspended": false,
      "verified_at": "2024-05-10T...",
      "last_login": "2025-01-03T...",
      "profile_completed": true
    }
  }
}
```

### **Frontend Data Flow**

1. **Initial Load**
   - `loadDashboardData()` → Fetches stats + activities
   - Auto-refresh activities every 30 seconds

2. **Tab Navigation**
   - `activeTab === 'users'` → `loadUsers()`
   - `activeTab === 'interactions'` → `loadJobInteractions()`

3. **User Interaction**
   - Click "View" button → `handleViewUserDetails(userId)`
   - Fetches detailed user data
   - Opens modal with `setShowUserDetails(true)`

4. **Filtering & Search**
   - Changes trigger `useEffect` → Reloads data with new params
   - Debounced search input (optional enhancement)

### **Routes Configuration**

```php
// backend/routes/api.php
Route::prefix('admin')->middleware('admin')->group(function () {
    Route::get('/dashboard', [AdminController::class, 'getDashboardStats']);
    Route::get('/users', [AdminController::class, 'getAllUsers']);
    Route::get('/users/{id}', [AdminController::class, 'getUserDetails']); // NEW
    Route::get('/jobs', [AdminController::class, 'getAllJobs']);
    Route::get('/activities', [AdminController::class, 'getRecentActivities']); // NEW
    // ... other admin routes
});
```

## 🚀 Usage Guide

### **For Administrators**

#### **Viewing All Users**
1. Navigate to Admin Dashboard
2. Click "User Management" tab
3. Use filters to narrow down:
   - User type (Client/Artisan)
   - Search by name/email/phone
   - Sort by date/name/email
4. Click "View" to see full details

#### **Understanding User Details**
- **Statistics**: Key metrics for user activity
- **Recent Jobs**: Last 10 jobs for context
- **Recent Payments**: Financial history
- **Account Info**: Verification and activity status

#### **Monitoring Platform Activity**
- Real-time activities panel updates every 30 seconds
- Priority levels indicate urgency:
  - **High**: Payments processed
  - **Medium**: Jobs posted
  - **Low**: User registrations

#### **Exporting Data**
- Use "Export" button in header
- Choose data type (Users, Jobs, Payments, Analytics)
- Select format (JSON or CSV)

## 📈 Performance Considerations

### **Pagination**
- Users: 20 per page
- Jobs: 10 per page
- Activities: 20 most recent
- Reduces initial load time

### **Lazy Loading**
- User details fetched only when requested
- Activities auto-refresh in background
- Tab content loads on demand

### **Database Queries**
- Using Eloquent relationships for efficient joins
- Eager loading (`with()`) to prevent N+1 queries
- Indexed columns for fast searching
